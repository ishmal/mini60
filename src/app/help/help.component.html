	<h3>How to use:</h3>

	<h4>Pairing</h4>
	<p>
		Pair your Android with the Mini60. Make sure that something like "MINI60" is listed in the paired Bluetooth device list.
		If it has another name, you can change the expected name in the configuration. The expected name is case-insensitive,
		and only needs to
		<i>start</i> the full name. For example, "mini" will match "MINI", "MINI 60", "MINI60 AT" etc. If the device is an original
		SARK100, then "sark" will probably work.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you start scanning, there will be a quick check that you have already paired with a device that has this
		kind of name.  If it is found, a connection to that device will be attempted.  If it is not found, an error message
		will be displayed.
	</p>

	<h4>Prepare the MINI60 for use</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Connect coaxial cable</li>
		<li>Turn on</li>
		<li>Press 'Set' twice so it shows 'PC Link'</li>
		<li>Press 'Down' until it says 'Waiting Link'</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Select a range to scan</h4>
	<p>
		You can either pick a band from the "Select" tab, or swipe the Analysis screen left or right to cycle through the preset ranges.
	</p>

	<h4>Scan</h4>
	<p>
		Double-tap on the Analysis page to start scanning. The red dot should turn to green (Connected) and/or blue (Scanning). The cyan cursor will move
		across the graph, showing scan progress. VSWR will be traced in red, impedance in green. If you do not see the curves,
		then they are off-scale. When the scan is completed, the dot will be green again. The point of minimum SWR will be indicated.
	</p>

	<h4>Configuration</h4>
	<p>
		The bluetooth device name is configurable.  You only need a case-insensitive prefix of the actual name,
		such as 'mini' or 'sark' as described above in "Pairing".
	</p>
	<p>
		The app comes with default frequency ranges for all of the HF bands and 60 meters. You can modify and rename any or all of
		them if you want. Your changes will be made persistent when you hit "Save". You can always get the original settings
		back by pressing the "Restore" button. There will be 30 steps for each range.
	</p>

	<h4>Finally</h4>
	<p>
		That is all. The command set for the Mini60 is very small, and there is not really that much
		that can be accomplished with it.  Hopefully this produces an informative chart from the available information.
		It is a simple device, and a simple app. Have fun!
